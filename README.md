# bubbles
Active Drawing with bubbles

For the effect I wanted, I was inspired for this idea while drinking some soft drink. As I was looking at the glass I was inspired by the carbonation and how it displayed an unpredictable bubble effect as each bubble moved around the glass. This also created the idea of coloring the bubbles to look like a soft drink. Since the colors were first overlapping each other, I had to create some opacity and resize the bubbles to make it more lifelike and carbonated. The bubbles also respond to mouse click causing it to pop and changes to its complementary color.
